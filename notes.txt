Write a JavaScript function called timings that uses Promises to take an array of times, and then print the numbers after that number of seconds. Use console.log to print to the screen. Hint, you can use map and Promise.all to creatively solve this. The timings function should return a Promise that resolves after the final print.

You will want to test your code using node or in the browser.
